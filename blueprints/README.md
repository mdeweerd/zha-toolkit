- `backup.yaml`:\
  Script for daily backup of supported zigbee coordinators.
- `backup_znp.yaml`:\
  Script for daily backup of ZNP coordinator.
- `blueprint_danfoss_ally_configure_script.yaml`:\
  Sample blueprint script to configure Danfoss Ally (see other script
  example for a more complete configuration)
- `danfoss_ally_remote_temperature.yaml`:\
  Send temperature to Danfoss Ally TRV at most every X minutes and at least
  every Y minutes. Uses restart to interrupt long wait ("y minutes")
- `danfoss_ally_remote_temperature_min_delay.yaml`:\
  Send temperature to Danfoss Ally at most every X minutes. Uses single to
  block too fast updates. In case the temperature is stable over a very
  long time, you should ensure that HA considers it is updated on every
  change.
- `danfoss_ally_remote_temperature_min_delay_fake_change.yaml`:\
  Same as `..._min_delay.yaml`. Work in progress - needs update of
  `home-assistant-variables`. Uses
  [snarky-snark/home-assistant-variables](https://github.com/snarky-snark/home-assistant-variables)
  to fake temperature update even when stable by applying slight change in
  temperature at the end of the minimum delay. So if the temperature is
  stable, it will still be seen as a change.
- `script_Thermometer_setReporting.yaml`:\
  Blueprint Script to configure reporting of a zigbee device with
  Temperature Measurement Cluster 0x0402.
