## Configure temperature reports by TRV or Thermometer

(Note: scripts can be called as a service)

- `script_TRV_setTemperatureReporting.yaml`:\
  Script to configure a TRV to report every 5 minutes or when temperature
  changed by 0.2°C.
- `script_Thermometer_setReporting.yaml`:\
  Script to configure a Thermometer to report every 5 minutes or when

## Download firmware from different sources.

See `fetchOTAfw.sh` for instructions. The download functionality is now
integrated in
[ota_notify](https://github.com/mdeweerd/zha-toolkit#ota_notify) which is
more selective. If you choose to use the script, you still need to trigger
the OTA update (which can be done using ota_notify).
